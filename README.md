# Project Background
TheLook is an eCommerce clothing site developed by the Looker team. The dataset contains information about customers, products, orders, logistics, web events and digital marketing campaigns. We will leverage SQL to answer key business questions that can inform strategies around marketing, sales, customer retention, and inventory management.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Top-selling products by category:** Identify which products generate the most revenue within each category. Understanding top sellers helps in inventory management and targeted marketing efforts.
- **Customer Purchase Behavior over time:** Analyzing purchase trends by month, in order to discover seasonal patterns in customer purchasing behavior, enabling better forecasting and marketing strategies.
- **Average Order Value (AOV) by Segment:** Segmenting customers based on purchase history and calculating their AOV can help tailor promotions and improve customer targeting.
- **Customer Retention Rate by Marketing Channel:** By examining retention rates for customers acquired through various marketing channels, we can assess the effectiveness of marketing strategies.
